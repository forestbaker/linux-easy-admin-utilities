The IT Infrastructure Analyst, IT Ops Engg., Systems Admin, IT Support Engg., IT Helpdesk Engg. Companies changes and Job tittles change but the responsibilities over lap and mix. My quest to make work fun, simple, joy and easy has lead to write, collect, source and use various scripts and tools that will help in a very easy and fun filled work flow with computers and IT systems.

This project is to write tools and utilities that make System Administration easy and simple. If a hard working Admin cannot have a beautiful wallpaper on his screen then the Admin can at least have one complete set utility tools that make the brow sweat free and achieve deadlines.
